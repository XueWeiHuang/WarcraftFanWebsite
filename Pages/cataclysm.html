                        <h4>Introduction</h4>                   
                        <p>World of Warcraft: Cataclysm (abbreviated as Cata), is the third expansion for World of Warcraft. Set primarily in a dramatically reforged Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms on the world of Azeroth, the expansion set follows the return of the evil Dragon Aspect Deathwing the Destroyer—formerly known as the ancient guardian Neltharion the Earth Warder—who causes a new Sundering as he makes his cataclysmic re-entrance into the world from Deepholm, the elemental plane of earth.</p>

                        <p>Cataclysm returns players to the two continents of Azeroth for most of their campaigning, after years away in Outland and Northrend, opening new zones such as Mount Hyjal, the sunken world of Vashj'ir, Deepholm, Uldum and the Twilight Highlands. It includes two new playable races, the worgen from the legendary kingdom of Gilneas for the Alliance, and the goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel from the isle of Kezan for the Horde. Among the many new developments in the expansion are the increase of the level cap to 85, the ability to use flying mounts in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms, the introduction of the secondary profession Archaeology, and the debut of reforging, as well as updates to player classes, new race-class combinations, and a dramatic restructuring of the world itself (with major revisions to existing content from the original release of the game).</p>
                        <p>World of Warcraft: Cataclysm was officially announced on August 21, 2009 at BlizzCon 2009. The "friends & family" phase of the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm alpha began on May 3, 2010, while closed beta began June 30, 2010.[3] Collectors' Edition content and pricing was announced on August 17, 2010, while on October 4, 2010, Blizzard Entertainment officially announced the release date for the expansion: December 7, 2010, including for the first time a digital download edition at release. On October 16, 2013, the expansion was integrated into the basic World of Warcraft package, granting all subscribers automatic access to all of the content and features of the expansion at no additional cost. This expansion came in two versions: Standard Edition and Collector's Edition.<sup>[1]</sup>
