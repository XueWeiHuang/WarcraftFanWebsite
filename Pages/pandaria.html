                        </figure>                        <h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>                   
                        <p>World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria (abbreviated as MoP or Mists) is the fourth expansion pack for World of Warcraft. It was officially announced on October 21, 2011 at BlizzCon 2011 and released on September 15, 2012. The pre-expansion patch was released on August 28, 2012. On October 16, 2014, the expansion was integrated into the basic World of Warcraft package, granting all subscribers automatic access to all of the content and features of the expansion at no additional cost.</p>

                        <p>Following the successful campaigns in Northrend and in the lands opened by the Shattering, and the deaths of the Lich King at Icecrown Citadel and Deathwing the Destroyer at the Maelstrom, the expansion refocuses primarily on the war between the Alliance and Horde, in the wake of the accidental rediscovery of the mythical and long-forgotten lands of Pandaria, a continent far to the south that has until now been shrouded in magical mists and touched by the ancient malevolence known only as the Sha. With both factions landing on Pandaria, adventurers rediscover the ancient pandaren people, whose wisdom will help guide them to new destinies; the Pandaren Empire's ancient enemy, the mantid; and their legendary oppressors, the enigmatic mogu. As conflicts heat up between the Alliance and Horde, the land changes over time, with subsequent patches having escalated the conflict between Alliance leader Varian Wrynn and the increasingly unbalanced Horde warchief Garrosh Hellscream... eventually leading to a schism within the Horde itself.</p> 
                        <p>As civil war wracks the Horde, the Alliance and forces in the Horde opposed to Hellscream's violent uprising join forces to take the battle directly to the enemy, leading to direct confrontation with Hellscream and his Sha-touched allies in the expansion's concluding showdown deep within the bowels of Orgrimmar itself.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

                        <div class="line"></div>
                        <h4 id="lore">Lore</h4>
                        <p>From the official site:</p>

                        <blockquote><p><q><i>Shrouded in fog since the world was sundered more than ten thousand years ago, the ancient realm of Pandaria has remained unspoiled by war. Its lush forests and cloud-ringed mountains are home to a complex ecosystem of indigenous races and exotic creatures. It is the homeland of the enigmatic Pandaren, a race that celebrates life to the fullest even while under siege by an ancient menace.<br><br>The new continent reveals itself to a broken world just as the Alliance and Horde are spiraling ever closer to a war that will consume all of Azeroth. Will the mists of Pandaria part to reveal the world's salvation? Or will the battle to control this rich and breathtaking new land push the two mighty factions over the brink of war and into total annihilation? The answers await within Pandaria's mysterious shores!</i></q></p></blockquote>

                        <p>As a first for Blizzard, the storyline for Mists of Pandaria will split into multiple chapters. The story arc that introduces Pandaria - where players will discover the continent and level up, helping to solve problems and figure out what happened for the past 10,000 years and why - will be included entirely within the initial expansion release. Later chapters in the storyline bring the war between the Horde and the Alliance back into focus, including changing parts of Pandaria (ostensibly via phasing) to show additional settlements, and eventually return the players back to the rest of the world for a final showdown with Garrosh Hellscream.</p>

                        <p>The Mists of Pandaria pre-release patch (5.0.4), released on 28 August 2012, included the talent system revamp, amalgamation of mounts & pets across characters on the same account, and a level 85 version of the Theramore's Fall scenario leading into the Mists storyline.<sup>[2]</sup></p>

                        <h4 id="races">New Races</h4>

                        <p>The pandaren—a race of anthropomorphic giant pandas initially created by veteran Blizzard artist Samwise Didier as an April Fools style joke—were later reintroduced to the Warcraft canon in the bonus Horde campaign of Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.</p>            
                        <figure id="pr"> 
                            <a href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Pandaren"><img src="../images/pandaren.jpg" alt="pandaren image" width="200" height="250"></a>
                        </figure>

                        <p> Unlike previous races in World of Warcraft, which are tied to either the Horde or Alliance in-game factions, pandaren are faction-neutral for the early levels of the game. Until the end of the principal quest line on the Wandering Isle, the pandaren player character is faction-less; at the end of their starting experience, the player chooses to align with either the Horde or the Alliance. The pandaren speak both the pandaren language (though the factional language barrier will still remain between Horde and Alliance pandaren) and the main languages of their faction, which are Common (Alliance) and Orcish (Horde). (In an interview with Kat Hunter, Chris Metzen jokingly said the languages had not yet been chosen but Pig Latin was a strong candidate.) The classes available to pandaren characters are Hunter, Monk, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Shaman and Warrior.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

                        <h4 id="playableclass">New Playable Class</h4>
                        <p>When the pandaren were subjugated by the mogu centuries ago, it was the monks that brought hope to a seemingly dim future. Restricted from using weapons by their slave masters, these pandaren instead focused on harnessing their chi and learning weaponless combat. When the opportunity for revolution struck, they were well-trained to throw off the yoke of oppression. Masters of bare-handed combat, monks never rely solely on the need to have a weapon in their hands to defend against their enemies. Although most widely known to the outside world for their fearsome jabs and flying kicks, they refuse to limit themselves to a single method of combat. </p>

                        <figure id="monk"> 
                            <a href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Monk"><img src="../images/monkclass.jpg" alt="monk class image" width="200" height="250"></a>
                        </figure>

                        <p>Many monks prefer instead to “soak it up” and seem to revel in the intoxicating effect of absorbing blow after blow while their companions press the attack. Other monks specialize in calling upon the restorative power of the mists to balance the good and bad energy within people, returning them to good health and fortune.Monks bring a unique martial arts style to any fight, and harness an exotic form of magical energy that’s unfamiliar to those who practice other arcane arts. They seek spiritual balance in life and in combat, and as dangerous as Monks can be on the battlefield, they’re rarely looking to pick a fight without just cause. They view the world through a different lens, finding power through serenity and inner peace—then expressing it through artful combat techniques and powers that mend life. Perhaps most surprisingly, Monks are also adept at producing powerful brews they consume to aid them in battle.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

                            <li>Talent system revamp: removal of point-based talent trees in favor of player class specialization being separated from talent choices, with a six-tier, three-choice per tier talent system determining play style (introduced in 5.0.4 pre-release patch)</li>

                            <li>Player Farms, a phased area in Valley of the Four Winds allowing players to make progress on arable farmland, gaining reputation and material rewards</li>
                            <li>Cross-Realm Zones, enable players to meet up and group with other players in under populated zones flagged for this</li>
