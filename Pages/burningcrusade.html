                        <h4>Introduction</h4>  
                                         
                        <p>World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade (abbreviated as TBC or BC) is the first expansion for World of Warcraft. It was announced on 28 October 2005 and released on 16 January 2007 in North America, Europe, and Australia; 2 February 2007 in Korea; 3 April 2007 in Taiwan and Hong Kong; and 6 September 2007 in mainland China. Its main features include an increase of the level cap up to 70, the introduction of the blood elves and the draenei as playable races, and the addition of the world of Outland, along with many new zones, dungeons, items, quests, and monsters.</p>
                        
                        <p>On 29 June 2011, the expansion was integrated into the basic World of Warcraft package, granting all subscribers access to all of the content and features of the expansion at no additional cost.This expansion came in two versions: Standard Edition and Collector's Edition.<sup>[1]</sup>

                        <div class="line"></div>
                        
                        <h4>Lore</h4>
                        
                        <p>The quests in The Burning Crusade are generally set in continuity with original lore quests, meaning that in relation to the timeline, the expansion is the direct sequel to the original World of Warcraft. Some quests set in Outland, especially those that are related to Illidan, mention a five-year hiatus in the storyline, which suggests a one-year interval between The Burning Crusade and the original game. This is unconfirmed however, since there never was any real statement that the events of Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne take place one year after Reign of Chaos. Regardless, it is generally agreed upon that there was a four year break between Warcraft III and the start of World of Warcraft.</p>

                        <p>The expansion introduces Outland, the former world of Draenor, and numerous quests essentially allowing players to explore the world on their own. The main storyline points to Illidan the Betrayer and what happened to him during the last four years. Players can also complete quests that involve either aiding Illidan or making preparations for his downfall.</p>

                        <p>In addition, there are many links between the former world of Draenor and the current Outland, such as the opening of the Dark Portal by Medivh, which is relived in the Caverns of Time, and various quest chains which provide insight into the history of the old Orcish shamans and their relationship with Burning Legion long before the First War.</p>

                        <p>The Burning Crusade also centers on the two new playable races and their affiliation to the game's storyline. Many plot holes are filled with quests that align the blood elves with the Horde and the draenei with the Alliance. Players still must complete quests in the old world of Azeroth to fully understand the lore related to Outland.<sup>[2]</sup></p>

                        <h4>New Races</h4>
                        
                        <p>There are two new races in this expansion: the Blood Elves for the Horde and the Draenei for the Alliance.</p>
                        
                        <figure id="bf"> <!-- The figure tag marks data (usually an image) that is part of the article -->

                        </figure>
                        
                        <p>The Blood Elves (Sin'dorei, meaning "Children of the Blood") are former High Elves that have been removed from the Alliance. In the Third War, the Undead Scourge invaded and destroyed their home of Quel'Thalas to destroy the Sunwell, the high elven source of magic. Without it, many high elves became frail and weak, and in their desperation, turned to fel (demonic) magic to sate their cravings. They then called themselves Blood Elves, in honor of their fallen kin. However, their addiction cost them their Human allies, and have instead joined the Horde in an effort to survive. Blood Elves can be played as hunters, warlocks, priests, paladins, rogues, mages.</p> 
                          
                        <p>The Draenei ("exiled ones" in their native tongue), originally called the Eredar, have an extensive history, spanning several thousand years. 25,000 years ago, the dark Titan Sargeras approached the three Eredar leaders, Archimonde, Kil'jaeden, and Velen, promising them untold power in exchange for their loyalty. However, the prophet Velen foresaw the destruction that they would cause under Sargeras, and gathered those who believed him and fled their homeworld with the help of the Naaru.</p> 
                        
                        <figure id="di"> <!-- The figure tag marks data (usually an image) that is part of the article -->
                        <a href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Draenei"><img src="../images/draeni.jpg" alt="draeni image" width="260" height="261"></a>
                        </figure>
                        
                        <p>Kil'jaeden and Archimonde, however, succumbed to Sargeras' promise of infinite power. After flying from world to world, Velen and his refugees ended up in Draenor, or what is known today as Outland, where they had a tenuous pact with the native orcs.                 
                        Eventually, the Orcs began to follow Kil'jaeden and started using shadow and fel magics. Kil'jaeden had persuaded the Orcs into the complete annihilation of the Draenei. The few that survived fled again on their ship, The Exodar, and crash landed on Azeroth, where they were welcomed into the Alliance for their devout faith in the light. The Draeneis can be as warriors, paladins, priests, shamans, hunters, mages.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
